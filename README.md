# Attribute-Based-Encryption
I design four attribute based encryption(ABE) schemes, including cipher-policy ABE, key-policy ABE, target key policy ABE and target cipher policy ABE.

In every ABE toolkit, the code is split into two packages, libbswabe (a library implementing the core crypto operations) and another abe library. Be sure to install the libbswabe first.

The implemetations of these four ABE scheme rely on many libraries, including GMP,PBC. Some other libraries, such as m4, bison, flexï¼Œ should also be installed before install abe library.
